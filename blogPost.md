Equipment no longer supported, needed to update and re-focus on OpenWRT

Found current router for $30 that can run OpenWRT, and has USB port for storage. 
Has a web server that can be used to serve static site, rather than just file sharing.

Used 11ty to create a static site, and serve it from the router.
Used PageFind to create in browser search of the site.
Use OpenSeaDragon for zoomable images.

User testing with the students. Will work to replicate the British Library interface using Universal Viewer as well as browse funtionality.
